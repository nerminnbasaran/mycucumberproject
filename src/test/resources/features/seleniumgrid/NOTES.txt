*****selenium grid notes*****
Official Documentation : https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/getting_started/
-----Installation Steps:-----
1. Prerequisites:
*Java 11 or higher installed
*Browser(s) installed
*Browser driver(s)
*Download the Selenium Server jar file from the latest release -NOT DONE YET
2. Create a folder under project  :  SeleniumServer
3. * Download the selenium server :  https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
   * Download the chrome driver   :  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
   * Download the firefox driver  :  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
   NOTE: move those files in the SeleniumServer folder then UNZIP
-----run the grid----
4. Open terminal(MAC) or CMD(WINDOWS) and change directory to the SeleniumServer folder
   To find the path : right click on the SeleniumServer folder > copy path/reference > copy absolute path
   To change directory : cd path_of_SeleniumServer folder
   For me : cd /Users/techproed/IdeaProjects/mycucumberproject/SeleniumServer
5. Run the grid standalone server
    java -jar selenium-server-4.10.0.jar standalone
    java -jar selenium-server-4.8.0.jar standalone
   Then you should see this message : Started Selenium Standalone 4.10.0 (revision c14d967899): http://192.168.1.66:4444

TROUBLESHOOTING :
   NOTES : if 4.10.0 is not working
   1. put 4.8.0 in SeleniumServer folder
   2. in your terminal close the previous session (Control +C)
   3. run this on the terminal : java -jar selenium-server-4.8.0.jar standalone
   4. run your runner one more time

   Now the hub and node runs and we are able to run the tests on grid....

   To close the server : Control C

6. Create a new feature file :grid_test_case.feature

7. Complete the step definitions. Make sure to use RemoteWebDriver

--What is Selenium Grid?
One of the selenium components. (RC,WebDriver,Grid,IDE)
--What is it used for?(can be answered on the first question)
*It is used to run test cases
    -on remote web driver
    -for cross-browser testing(chrome,firefox,safari,edge...)
    -for parallel testing(normal framework should be configured for parallel testing for example, testng parallel testing)
    -for running on different operating systems such as IOS, windows
*Did you use selenium grid?
    -yes I used in my project for cross browser testing
*How do you run tests on grid?
    -I use selenium server and drivers in the same directory
    -Then we should run the server. I use standalone mode : java -jar selenium-server-4.8.0.jar standalone
    -with grid 4, we have options to run 1.standalone mode. 2.distributed mode. 3. using HUB and NODE(same as grid 3)
*What is HUB?
    -Hub is the server that managed the nodes. we can have singe hub
    java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub
*What is NODE?
    -node is the remote virtual machines. we can have multiple nodes
    java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node





******SELENIUM GRID(FROM PRESENTATION )******
It enables running Selenium tests on multiple machines and browsers simultaneously
(Parallel testing and cross browser testing, remote testing)
The architecture involves two main components: the Hub and the Nodes.
The Hub acts as a central server that controls the execution of tests.
Nodes are individual machines that execute the test scripts.
Nodes register with the Hub and checks their availability with specific browser and platform configurations
The Hub receives test requests and delegates them to available nodes based on the requested configurations
*It is useful for testing web applications across different browsers, operating systems and device configurations

HUB	: is a server that drives the parallel test execution on different machines.
NODE	: is a virtual machine that is registered to a hub

WHAT IS CROSS BROWSER TESTING?
-to test the same cases on different browsers
-for ex. We can test login functionality on a chrome and firefox
HOW?
-There are different ways to do cross browser testing
-Ä±n TestNG we can configure our testing xml files to do cross browser testing .We can also use Selenium Grid
-In Cucumber ->We can use Selenium Grid
