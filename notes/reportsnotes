REPORTS

Why reports are important?
-We need proof for test execution
*demo meeting to show PO
*if the existing code breaks, then you can refer to the existing reports
How do you manage/use reports?
-We upload the test reports in JIRA(or some other tool) attaching the related user story
-I can easily check the reports when team needs
-I make sure, I take the screenshot for each scenario as future reference
-My automation script take the screenshot whenever a test case fails,I use Hooks for this reason
What do you do when test case fails?
-I rerun my automation script(I used FailedRunner class for running only failed scenarios)
-I manually check if script fails again
-I prepare a report, take screenshot and share with the team. If a bug, then we raise a ticket
NOTE: We should take screen whenever needed as a proof of test execution
For this reason, we have a reusable cucumber step for taking screenshot

What are the different ways to get reports in cucumber?
-With cucumber plugins in the runner class.No need to add any dependency. Html,jsonixml
-Extent spark reports: to get more advanced reports
Add dependencies
Add config files
-Cucumber maven-cucumber reporting plugin
This generated by running from the commend prompt(mvn clean verify)
-How to attach screenshot I the html report?
In my framework, I have hooks class. In @after method class I have getScreenShotAs method to get captures and attaches the screenshot when a test case fails
In addition to this automatic screenshot setup, I have another method(capture the screenshot) that I run ANYTIME to capture the screenshot. I use this at the end of assertions as proof
