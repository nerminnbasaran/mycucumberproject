-Parallel testing Is done using multiple browser at the same time(simultaneously)
*Thread: code
*Thread-Safe: in thread safe code parallel testing Is possible. Thread-safe means that a method or class instance can be used by multiple threads at the same time without any problems occurring

-How do you do Parallel Testing?
*Cucumber
*TestNG
*Selenium Grids
*Jenkins

*There are alternative websites for parallel/remote test executions
-Sauce Labs
-Browser Stuck

*How do you do parallel testing with cucumber?
We will create multiple Runners and run then at the same time using maven comment
Then we will configure our pom.xml file to support parallel testing
-Surefire plugin
-Failsafe plugin : failsafe helps test fail safely. It helps other tests run safely even if a test case fails
Then we will run from terminal : mvn clean verify

DEPENDENCY VS PLUGIN
-Dependency provides set of classes
-Plugins provides a feature that is limited. It provides extra functionality during the execution.

INTERVIEW QUESTION:
Did you do parallel testing?
-Yes, I did
How do you parallel testing?
-Create multiple runner: smoke test runner, regression test runner, addtocartTestRunner
-Add required plugins
*Surefire: runs the test cases parallel mode.
*Failsafe: if test case fails continue to run other tests safely
-run using maven commands, mvn clean install
What are the required plugin for parallel?
-maven failsafe(safe run even after some test failure), maven surefire(for parallel testing thread-count is in this plugin) and maven cucumber reporting(generation reports)
When did you do parallel testing?
I normally donâ€™t do parallel testing in the sprints. But if I do regression testing, I can do parallel testing to save time
